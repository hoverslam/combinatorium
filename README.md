## Games

A table for complexities of some well-known games can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_complexity#Complexities_of_some_well-known_games).

### Tic-tac-toe [:link:](https://github.com/hoverslam/combinatorium/tree/main/combinatorium/tic_tac_toe)

Tic-tac-toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. Players take turns marking spaces with an ***X*** or ***O***. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins. This game is a great introduction to basic game mechanics and strategic thinking. The state space complexity is rather small with only 5 478 different states (after removing illegal positions). Reference: [Wikipedia | Tic-tac-toe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe)

### Connect Four [:link:](https://github.com/hoverslam/combinatorium/tree/main/combinatorium/connect_four)

Connect Four is another two-player game played on a 7x6 grid. Players take turns dropping colored discs into one of the seven columns. The discs fall down the column and land on the first available space. The goal is to be the first player to connect four of your discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Agents

### Minimax [:link:](https://github.com/hoverslam/combinatorium/blob/66827fa91303bf80b6b7a0a069a5453a899b9c01/combinatorium/agents/simple.py#L6)

Minimax is a fundamental decision-making algorithm used for two-player zero-sum games. It explores all possible game continuations and chooses the move that leads to the best outcome for itself (or the worst outcome for the opponent).

Reference: [Wikipedia | Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax)

### Alpha-beta pruning [:link:](https://github.com/hoverslam/combinatorium/blob/66827fa91303bf80b6b7a0a069a5453a899b9c01/combinatorium/agents/simple.py#L80)

Alpha-beta pruning is an optimization technique used to improve the efficiency of the minimax algorithm. It prunes away branches that can't possibly be the best option, focusing on more promising parts of the search tree.

Reference: [Wikipedia | Alphaâ€“beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning)

### Negamax [:link:](https://github.com/hoverslam/combinatorium/blob/66827fa91303bf80b6b7a0a069a5453a899b9c01/combinatorium/agents/simple.py#L166)

Negamax is a variant of minimax that simplifies the implementation for zero-sum games. It transforms the game into a maximization problem for both players, regardless of whose turn it is.
